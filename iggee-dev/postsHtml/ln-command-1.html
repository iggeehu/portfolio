      What the hell is inside the ln command 1/2

      I have a bad habit that I occasionally indulge in, which makes it very
      hard for me to finish any books: going into rabbit holes. Recently, I was
      reading the book “Understanding The Linux Kernel”, and was caught up in
      the “Hard and Soft Link” section on page 14. Obviously, the rabbit hole
      happened before I went very far. On the page is the following text:
    </p>
    <br />
    <pre class="bg-silver-tree-300 text-sm"><code>The Unix command:
$ ln p1 p2
is used to create a new hard link that has the pathname p2
for a file identified by the pathname p1.

Hard links have two limitations:
\- It is not possible to create hard links for directories.
Doing so might transform the directory tree into a graph with
cycles, thus making it impossible to locate a file according to
its name.
</code></pre>
    <br />
    <p>
      A self-referential directory going in an infinite loop? I had the
      curiosity to look into the
      <code class="bg-silver-tree-300 text-sm">ln.c</code> source code in the
      <a href="https://github.com/coreutils/coreutil">coreutils</a> library.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      After 5 minutes of reading the code and perspiring generously, I decided
      maybe it’s wise to look at the manpage for ln first. After all, it’s
      better to know what something is supposed to do, before looking at how it
      is done.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Below is the elegant explanation of the
      <code class="bg-silver-tree-300 text-sm">ln</code> command:
    </p>
    <br />
    <pre class="bg-silver-tree-300 text-sm"><code>SYNOPSIS
 ln \[OPTION\]… \[-T\] TARGET LINK\_NAME
 ln \[OPTION\]… TARGET
 ln \[OPTION\]… TARGET… DIRECTORY
 ln \[OPTION\]… -t DIRECTORY TARGET…

DESCRIPTION
 In the 1st form, create a link to TARGET with the name
 LINK\_NAME. In the 2nd form, create a link to TARGET in the
 current directory. In the 3rd and 4th forms, create links
 to each TARGET in DIRECTORY. Create hard links by default,
 symbolic links with - symbolic. By default, each destina‐
 tion (name of new link) should not already exist. When cre‐
 ating hard links, each TARGET must exist. Symbolic links
 can hold arbitrary text; if later resolved, a relative link
 is interpreted in relation to its parent directory.
</code></pre>
    <br />
    <p>I tried out the first form like so:</p>
    <br /><br />
    <img
      src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/format:webp/1*r5IGwi2sBZ-dKGTFawfE7w.png"
    />
    <br /><br />
    <p>
      I created two files in my Downloads/BOOK directory,
      <code class="bg-silver-tree-300 text-sm">file 1</code> and
      <code class="bg-silver-tree-300 text-sm">file 2</code>. I created file1 to
      be <code class="bg-silver-tree-300 text-sm">TARGET</code> and file2 to be
      <code class="bg-silver-tree-300 text-sm">LINK_NAME</code>. I thought that
      I needed to create
      <code class="bg-silver-tree-300 text-sm">LINK_NAME</code> before mapping
      <code class="bg-silver-tree-300 text-sm">TARGET</code> as its destination.
      And when I tried
      <code class="bg-silver-tree-300 text-sm">ln file1 file2</code>, I was told
      “failed to create hard link ‘file2’: File exists”, which means, “Hey, this
      name file2 is taken, come up with a new link name!”
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Ok, ok. I wrote ‘ln file1 file3", and assumed that this command will
      create a new file, file3. I peeked into file3. And nicely, it gives me the
      same content as file1. We created a portal into file1.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Now my question is: are file1 and file3 the same kind of files? Is file3 a
      special kind of secondary pointers to file1, the ‘original’, or are both
      files of exactly the same kind, but separate portals into the same content
      on disk? What is the data structure of a “hard link”? Are all ordinary
      files just hard links? I had a little exposure to the idea of fd (file
      descriptors) and inode. But I don’t quite fit all the knowledge together.
      Here is what I know:
    </p>
    <br />
    <ul>
      <li>A file is a sequence of bytes.</li>
      <li>
        An inode is a data structure kept by the file system to describe a file.
        The inode contains information such as file type, file length, device
        types, etc.
      </li>
      <li>A file descriptor is a unique identifier to an open file.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I decided to overlook the more complex ways this command can be used, and
      went on a hunt for the answer for my specific command
      <code class="bg-silver-tree-300 text-sm">ln file1 file3</code> in the
      source code.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Since the source code will surely encompass all the options. And I am only
      inquiring form 1 of the command:
    </p>
    <br />
    <pre class="bg-silver-tree-300 text-sm"><code>
ln \[OPTION\]… \[-T\] TARGET LINK\_NAME (create a link of LINK\_NAME of TARGET, put it in current directory)
</code></pre>
    <br />
    <p>
      I need to narrow down what to look for in the source code. First, I should
      seek the <code class="bg-silver-tree-300 text-sm">-T</code> block, which,
      according to the manpage, means “no target directory”.
    </p>
    <br />
    <pre
      class="bg-silver-tree-300 text-sm"
    ><code> -t, --target-directory=DIRECTORY
              specify the DIRECTORY in which to create the links

       -T, --no-target-directory
              treat LINK\_NAME as a normal file always
</code></pre>
    <br />
    <p>
      Looking down the <code class="bg-silver-tree-300 text-sm">main()</code> of
      <code class="bg-silver-tree-300 text-sm">ln.c</code>, I found what I am
      looking for:
    </p>
    <br />
    <pre class="bg-silver-tree-300 text-sm"><code>
int
main (int argc, char \*\*argv)
{
   //parsing all the options, throwing errors
   //on non-legit args, basically busywork stuff
   ...

    if (n\_files == 2 &#x26;&#x26; !target\_directory)
        link\_errno = atomic\_link (file\[0\], AT\_FDCWD, file\[1\]);

      if (link\_errno &#x3C; 0 || link\_errno == EEXIST || link\_errno == ENOTDIR
          || link\_errno == EINVAL)
        {
          ...
        }
    }

}
</code></pre>
    <br />
    <p>
      So it seems like the operation is done by the
      <code class="bg-silver-tree-300 text-sm">atomic_link</code> function, and
      immediately after, we are doing operations based on the result,
      <code class="bg-silver-tree-300 text-sm">link_errno</code>. Now let’s peek
      into <code class="bg-silver-tree-300 text-sm">atomic_link</code>:
    </p>
    <br />
    <pre class="bg-silver-tree-300 text-sm"><code>
/\* Link SOURCE to DESTDIR\_FD + DEST\_BASE atomically.  DESTDIR\_FD is
   the directory containing DEST\_BASE.  Return 0 if successful, a
   positive errno value on failure, and -1 if an atomic link cannot be
   done.  This handles the common case where the destination does not
   already exist and -r is not specified.  \*/

static int
atomic\_link (char const \*source, int destdir\_fd, char const \*dest\_base)
{
  return (symbolic\_link
          ? (relative ? -1
             : errnoize (symlinkat (source, destdir\_fd, dest\_base)))
          : beware\_hard\_dir\_link ? -1
          : errnoize (linkat (AT\_FDCWD, source, destdir\_fd, dest\_base,
                              logical ? AT\_SYMLINK\_FOLLOW : 0)));
}
</code></pre>
    <br />
    <p>
      First of all, I am sure whoever wrote this nested conditional operator
      probably had a lot of fun.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Second of all, my first file, file1, or
      <code class="bg-silver-tree-300 text-sm">TARGET</code>, is passed as
      <code class="bg-silver-tree-300 text-sm">source</code>.
      <code class="bg-silver-tree-300 text-sm">AT_FDCWD</code> has “FD” (file
      descriptor) and “CWD” (current working directory), it’s safe to assume int
      <code class="bg-silver-tree-300 text-sm">AT_FDCWD</code>, passed in as
      <code class="bg-silver-tree-300 text-sm">destdir_fd</code> is just the
      file descriptor of my current directory. Also, since I passed relative
      paths in my original command, it makes sense for the function to pass in
      my current directory. And my
      <code class="bg-silver-tree-300 text-sm">file3</code>, or
      <code class="bg-silver-tree-300 text-sm">LINK_NAME</code>, is passed as
      <code class="bg-silver-tree-300 text-sm">dest_base</code>.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Now it’s time to parse this nested conditional operator into
      human-readable pseudocode:
    </p>
    <br />
    <pre
      class="bg-silver-tree-300 text-sm"
    ><code>IF symbolic\_link (I won't need this, bc the default is hardlink):

    relative ? -1
             : errnoize (symlinkat (source, destdir\_fd, dest\_base))


IF not, or hard link (I need this):
    beware\_hard\_dir\_link ? -1
          : errnoize (linkat (AT\_FDCWD, source, destdir\_fd, dest\_base,
                              logical ? AT\_SYMLINK\_FOLLOW : 0)));
</code></pre>
    <br />
    <p>
      A quick look at
      <code class="bg-silver-tree-300 text-sm">beware_hard_dir_link</code> just
      shows that this is a warning about making a hard link of directories:
    </p>
    <br />
    <pre
      class="bg-silver-tree-300 text-sm"
    ><code>/\* If true, watch out for creating or removing hard links to directories.  \*/
static bool beware\_hard\_dir\_link;
</code></pre>
    <br />
    <p>
      So it seems like if we try to create a hard link of directories, the
      function will return -1, AKA spit us out and refuse our rude request.
      Otherwise, we get to finally (note: definitely not finally) do the
      linking:
    </p>
    <br />
    <pre
      class="bg-silver-tree-300 text-sm"
    ><code>linkat (AT\_FDCWD, source, destdir\_fd, dest\_base,
                              logical ? AT\_SYMLINK\_FOLLOW : 0))

</code></pre>
    <br />
    <p>
      Now, I need to determine whether
      <code class="bg-silver-tree-300 text-sm">logical</code> is true. The
      Manpage explains logical as such:
    </p>
    <br />
    <pre class="bg-silver-tree-300 text-sm"><code> -L, --logical
              dereference TARGETs that are symbolic links
</code></pre>
    <br />
    <p>
      Since I did not pass in the L argument, and my target is not a symbolic
      link, safe to say the logical is false and our flag value is 0.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      After a while of poking at the gnulib files, I finally found the
      implementation of
      <a href="https://github.com/coreutils/gnulib/blob/master/lib/linkat.c"
        >linkat</a
      >:
    </p>
    <br />
    <pre
      class="bg-silver-tree-300 text-sm"
    ><code>linkat (int fd1, char const \*file1, int fd2, char const \*file2, int flag)
{
  if (flag &#x26; ~AT\_SYMLINK\_FOLLOW)
    {
      errno = EINVAL;
      return -1;
    }
  return at\_func2 (fd1, file1, fd2, file2,
                   flag ? link\_follow : link\_immediate);
}
</code></pre>
    <br />
    <p>
      Ok, turns out linkat is yet another wrapper function. It wraps at_func2,
      which “translates” our flag of value 0 into the
      <code class="bg-silver-tree-300 text-sm">link_immediate</code>, whatever
      that means. Let’s conjure up the signature of
      <a
        href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&#x26;rct=j&#x26;q=&#x26;esrc=s&#x26;source=web&#x26;cd=&#x26;ved=2ahUKEwj6s5v4n8j_AhW1kYkEHZXzBFUQFnoECA0QAQ&#x26;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsvn.netlabs.org%2Frepos%2Fports%2Fcoreutils%2Fvendor%2F8.25%2Flib%2Fat-func2.c&#x26;usg=AOvVaw3caZgzWXz0ipPnRdzRsFUC"
        >atfunc2</a
      >
      (warning, this is a direct download of a c file):
    </p>
    <br />
    <pre
      class="bg-silver-tree-300 text-sm"
    ><code>/\* Call FUNC to operate on a pair of files, where FILE1 is relative to FD1,

int

          int fd2, char const \*file2,
          int (\*func) (char const \*file1, char const \*file2))
</code></pre>
    <br />
    <p>
      Voila, link_immediate turns out to be a function. The plot thickens (or
      continues to unwrap).
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      At this point, we have looked so many signatures, we forgot which of
      TARGET (file1), LINK_NAME(file3), and AT_FDCWD(current directory) is
      passed in as which argument. Let’s stack it down:
    </p>
    <br />
    <pre
      class="bg-silver-tree-300 text-sm"
    ><code>(TARGET=file1 LINK\_NAME=file3)

                              logical ? AT\_SYMLINK\_FOLLOW : 0))

atfunc(AT\_FDCWD, TARGET, AT\_FDCWD, LINK\_NAME, link\_immediate)


</code></pre>
    <br />
    <p>
      Are we there yet? I don’t know, but it seems like we might call
      link_immediate which takes TARGET, LINK_NAME, and our current directory as
      arguments. Reading down the atfunc2 function, a very nice person has
      written some human-readable text. And I neatly found my specific situation
      among them:
    </p>
    <br />
    <pre
      class="bg-silver-tree-300 text-sm"
    ><code>/\* There are 16 possible scenarios, based on whether an fd is
