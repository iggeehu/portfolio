                <p>I am very happy to be accepted to Recurse Center. Tomorrow, March 27th, will be the first day of the batch.</p>
                <p>There are a few new areas of knowledge I am interested in, by order of importance:</p>
                <p>1. Operating Systems, with an emphasis on the Linux Kernel.</p>
                <p>2. Networking, most importantly, the TCP/IP protocol.</p>
                <p>3. Distributed systems with a focus on Cloud computing.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>As to the concrete projects that come of this, I am trying to keep an open mind and let them come.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>There are also a few residual things I need to finish up from past efforts:</p>
                <p>1. Eventually scale & bring my Immigence site online in a real way.</p>
                <p>2. Finish the "collected list" and "reading rooms" functionalities of my bookList app.</p>
                <p>3. Deploy the bookList app to Github Pages.</p>
                <p>4. Polish this portfolio site & link it to the domain name</p>
                <p>5. Contribute to the <a href="https://github.com/rq/rq">Redis Queue</a> library, my goal is to have another 2-3 PRs merged</p>
