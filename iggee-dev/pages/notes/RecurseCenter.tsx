                <p>I am very happy to be accepted to Recurse Center. Tomorrow, March 27th, will be the first day of the batch.</p>
                <p>There are a few new areas of knowledge I am interested in, by order of importance:</p>
                <p>1. Operating Systems, with an emphasis on the Linux Kernel.</p>
                <p>2. Networking, most importantly, the TCP/IP protocol.</p>
                <p>3. Distributed systems with a focus on Cloud computing.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>As to the concrete projects that come of this, I am trying to keep an open mind and let them come.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>There are also a few residual things I need to finish up from past efforts:</p>
                <p>1. Eventually scale & bring my Immigence site online in a real way.</p>
                <p>2. Finish the collected list and reading rooms functionalities of my bookList app.</p>
                <p>3. Deploy the bookList app to Github Pages.</p>
                <p>4. Polish this portfolio site & link it to the domain name</p>
                <p>5. Contribute to the <a href="https://github.com/rq/rq">Redis Queue</a> library, my goal is to have another 2-3 PRs merged</p>

                <p>The welcome call and the meet-and-greet were very fun. At some point the facilitator said that we could 
                    leave if we feel overwhelmed by all the socialization. TBH, I did feel a bit overwhelmed. But it is worth
                    pushing through and talking to as many people as possible.</p>
                <p>My batchmates are working on some very fun things: audio signal compiler, network protocol that bypasses censorship.
                    I have to follow up with some of their projects.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg font-bold">What I did today:</p>
                <p>1. Read about 20 pages of the Operating System: Three Easy Pieces Book.</p>
                <p>2. Wrote a blog post about fair-share scheduling and multicore scheduling. Blog posts. or study notes,
                    are very helpful for reviewing content I learned about earlier. It did take a bit too long.</p>
                <p>3. Did a DFS leetcode question. The tweaking of the DFS recursive functon is the fun part and sometimes
                    can go very wrong. Jaja!
                </p>
                <p>4. Went to a Distributed System Reading Group.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>I would say I did about 60% of what I set out to do, which is always the case in my biting-off-more-than-can-chew
                style</p>
            
                <p className="text-lg font-bold">Plan for tomorrow:</p>
                <p>1. Pairing workshop.</p>
                <p>2. Read about 20 pages of the Operating System: Three Easy Pieces Book.</p>
                <p>3. Read about 20 pages of the TCP/IP Illustrated book.</p>
                <p>3. Afternoon hack and tell 5-7pm, probably have to take care of the baby 3-5pm in exchange for the late session.
                    So grandma will not be overtired. </p>
                <p>4. 1 DFS leetcode question.</p>
